# Button Traffic Light

Button Traffic Light is an Assembly program that sets up a combination of leds, in an Arduino UNO using the ATMega328P microchip, to act like a traffic light with a button for pedestrians to cross the street.

You can test this program on the following page, [Arduino Button Traffic Light](https://wokwi.com/projects/400141345459998721).
(KIM the button doesn't work some times so you might need to press it two or three times to work)
