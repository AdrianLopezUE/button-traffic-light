# Button Traffic Light

Button Traffic Light is an Assembly program that sets up a combination of leds, in an Arduino UNO using the ATMega328P microchip, to act like a traffic light with a button for pedestrians to cross the street.

You can test this program on the following page, [Arduino Button Traffic Light](https://wokwi.com/projects/400141345459998721).
(KIM the simulator sometimes skips the line 41 when the simulation starts. This makes the simulation start the traffic light loop, in case it happens, stop the simulation and start it again.)
